    <h1>My favorite types of cupcakes</h1>
    <h2>Pick your treat</h2>
    <p class="intro">In the early 19th century, there were two different uses
      for the name cup cake or cupcake. In previous centuries, before muffin tins
      were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery
      cups, ramekins, or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked
      in. This is the use of the name that has remained, and the name of
      "cupcake" is now given to any small cake that is about the size of a teacup.
      While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcakes,
      they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate icing.</p>
